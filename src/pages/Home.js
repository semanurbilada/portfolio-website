            The web is a vast and powerful tool. Over the course of a few decades, <br></br> the internet has changed the way we work, the way we play and the way we interact with one another.

In a short period of time we’ve gone from being amazed by the ability to send an email to someone around the world, to a change in how we think of information. It’s not a question of how much you know anymore, but simply a question of what browser or app can get you to that information fastest.
