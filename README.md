## Purpose
<div align="justify">

Welcome to my portfolio website project!

This project showcases my work and serves as a demonstration of my skills in web development. It started with React and Tailwind CSS as the core technologies, and later evolved to include TypeScript for better type safety, enhanced performance, and an extended learning experience.

The website is designed to be a dynamic and visually appealing platform that reflects my capabilities and achievements. Feel free to explore the [live site](https://semanurbilada.github.io/portfolio-website/) or the source code!
